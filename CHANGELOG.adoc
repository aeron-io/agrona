== 2.3.2 (2025-11-08)

* Prevent concurrent `MarkFile` activation when `org.agrona.MarkFile.mapNewOrExistingMarkFile` is used.
+
If the mark file already exists and is not active, then the activity timestamp (`timestampFieldOffset`) is atomically
set to a special sentinel value (`org.agrona.MarkFile.ACTIVATION_IN_PROGRESS_TIMESTAMP`) to prevent other processes from
concurrent activation.
+
*NB:* If the current activation fails it will leave the activity timestamp at a sentinel value which will prevent a
restart of the process. Therefore, it is recommended to reset the activity timestamp upon failure.

== 2.3.1 (2025-11-03)

* Fixed racy file creation in `org.agrona.MarkFile.mapNewOrExistingMarkFile`. (https://github.com/aeron-io/agrona/issues/340[#340])
* Upgrade to `ByteBuddy` 1.17.8.
* Upgrade to `Checkstyle` 12.1.1.
* Upgrade to `JUnit` 6.0.1.

== 2.3.0 (2025-09-29)

* *[Breaking]* Changed `org.agrona.concurrent.ShutdownSignalBarrier` to use shutdown hooks instead of signals.
+
Previously `ShutdownSignalBarrier` relied on intercepting `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`
 https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html[OS signals] by overriding JVM's signal handling which was
 preventing shutdown hooks from be executed. This in turn was breaking applications and frameworks that relied on
 shutdown hooks for clean termination.
+
New implementation uses shutdown hooks instead and requires `ShutdownSignalBarrier` to be explicitly closed.
+
_**NB: Failure to close `ShutdownSignalBarrier` might result in JVM not terminating!**_
+
As the result the code using `ShutdownSignalBarrier` needs to be updated:
+
- Old:
+
[source,java]
----
class UsageSample
{
    public static void main(final String[] args) 
    {
        try (MyService service = new MyService())
        {
            new ShutdownSignalBarrier().await();
        }
    }
}
----
+
- New:
+
[source,java]
----
class UsageSample
{ 
    public static void main(final String[] args) 
    {
        try (ShutdownSignalBarrier barrier = new ShutdownSignalBarrier();
             MyService service = new MyService())
        {
            barrier.await();
        }
    }
}
----
+
In the above example `ShutdownSignalBarrier` is closed last to ensure that `service` terminates completely before
`ShutdownSignalBarrier` closes which in turn allows JVM to exit.

* *[Breaking]* Deprecated `org.agrona.concurrent.SigInt` for removal. Use
`org.agrona.concurrent.ShutdownSignalBarrier` instead.
+
_**NB:** `org.agrona.concurrent.SigInt.register(java.lang.Runnable)` is unsafe as it overrides `SIGINT` signal
 handling of the JVM thus preventing shutdown hooks from being executed._
+
An example using `ShutdownSignalBarrier` instead of `SigInt`:
+
- Old:
+
[source,java]
----
class FlagSample
{
    public static void main(final String[] args)
    {
        final AtomicBoolean running = new AtomicBoolean(false);
        SigInt.register(() -> running.set(false));
        while(running.get())
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}
----

- New:
+
[source,java]
----
class FlagSample
{
    public static void main(final String[] args)
    {
        final AtomicBoolean running = new AtomicBoolean(true);
        try (ShutdownSignalBarrier barrier = new ShutdownSignalBarrier(() -> running.set(false))
        {
            while (running.get())
            {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
